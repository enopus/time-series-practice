-This dataset was formatted by R. Olszewski as part of his thesis Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data at Carnegie Mellon University, 2001. Wafer data relates to semi-conductor microelectronics fabrication. A collection of inline process control measurements recorded from various sensors during the processing of silicon wafers for semiconductor fabrication constitute the wafer database; each data set in the wafer database contains the measurements recorded by one sensor during the processing of one wafer by one tool. The two classes are normal and abnormal. There is a large class imbalance between normal and abnormal (10.7% of the train are abnormal, 12.1% of the test).
